Simple Storage Service (S3): 

➢ S3 is a storage for the internet. It has a simple web service interface for simple 
storing and retrieving of any amount of data, anytime from anywhere on the 
internet. 
➢ S3 is object based storage. 
➢ You cannot install operating system on S3. 
➢ S3 has a distributed data store architecture where objects are redundantly stored 
in multiple locations. (minimum 3 locations in same region) 
➢ Data is stored in bucket. 
➢ A bucket is a flat container of objects. 
➢ Maximum capacity of a bucket is 5TB. 
➢ You can create folders in your bucket (available through console) 
➢ You cannot create nested buckets. 
➢ Bucket ownership is non transferrable. 
➢ S3 bucket is region specific. 
➢ You can have up to 100 buckets per account. (may expand on request) 

S3 Bucket Naming Rules: 
➢ S3 bucket names (keys) are globally unique across all AWS regions. 
➢ Bucket names cannot be change after they are created. 
➢ If bucket is deleted its name become available again to you or other account to use. 
➢ Bucket names must be at least 3 and no more than 63 characters long. 
➢ Bucket names are part of URL used to access a bucket. 
➢ Bucket name must be a series of one or more labels (xyz bucket) 
➢ Bucket names can contain lowercase, numbers and hyphen but cannot use uppercase 
letters. 
➢ Bucket name should not be an IP address. 
➢ Each label must start and end with a lowercase letter or a number. 
➢ By default buckets and its objects are private, and by default only owner can access the 
bucket. 

S3 Bucket Sub-Resources: 
Sub-resources of S3 bucket includes: 

Lifecycle: to decide on objects lifecycle management. 
Website: to hold configurations related to static website hosted in S3 buckets. 
Versioning: keep objects versions as it changes (set updated) 
Access Control List: bucket policies 
The name is simply two parts: bucket region’s end point / bucket name 
Example: for S3 bucket named mybucket in Europe west region is 
https://s3-eu-west1.amazonaws.com/mybucket 

S3 Objects: 
➢ An object size stored in an S3 bucket can be 0 byte to 5TB. 
➢ Each object is stored and retrieve by unique key. (ID or name) 
➢ An object in AWS S3 is uniquely identified and addressed through: 
• service endpoint 
• bucket name 
• object key (name) 
• optionally object version 
➢ Object stored in a S3 bucket in a region will never leave that region unless you 
specifically move them to another region or CRR. 
➢ A bucket owner can grant cross account permissions to another AWS account (or users 
in another account) to upload objects. 
➢ You can grant S3 bucket / object permission to: 
• Individual users 
• AWS account 
• Make the resource public 
• To all authenticate user 

S3 Bucket Versioning: 
➢ Bucket versioning is a S3 bucket sub resource used to protect against accidental 
object/data deletion or overwrites. 
➢ Versioning can also be used for data retention and archive. 
➢ Once you enable versioning on a bucket it cannot be disabled however it can be 
suspended. 
➢ When enable, bucket versioning will protect existing and new objects and maintains 
their versions as they are updated. 
➢ Updating objects refers to PUT, POST, COPY, DELETE actions on objects. 
➢ When versioning is enable and you try to delete an object a delete marker is placed on 
the object. 
➢ You can still view the object and delete the marker. 
➢ If you reconsider deleting the objects you can delete the delete marker and the object 
will be enable again. 
➢ You will be charged for all S3 storage cost for all object versions stored. 
➢ You can use versioning with S3 lifecycle policies to delete older version or you can 
move them to a cheaper S3 storage (Glacier.) 



STORAGE CLASSES OF AMAZON S3: 
There are 6 types of storage classes of Amazon S3 is available such as: 
1. Amazon S3 Standard 
2. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive 
3. Amazon Glacier 
4. Amazon S3 Standard Infrequent Access 
5. Amazon S3 one-zone-IA 
6. Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering 


1. Amazon S3 Standard: 
➢ S3 standard offers high durability, availability and performance object storage 
for frequently accessed data. 
➢ Durability is 99.999999999%. 
➢ Designed for 99.99% availability over a given year. 
➢ Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest. 
➢ The storage cost for the object is fairly high but there is very less charge for 
accessing the objects. 
➢ Largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT in 5GB. 

2. Amazon S3 IA (standard): 
➢ S3-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when 
needed. 
➢ The storage cost is much cheaper than S3-standard almost half the price, but 
you are charged more heavily for accessing your objects. 
➢ Durability is 99.999999999%. 
➢ Resilient against events that impact an entire AZ. 
➢ Availability is 99.9% in a year. 
➢ Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest. 
➢ Data that is deleted from S3-IA within 30 days will be charged for a full 30 
days. 
➢ Backed with the Amazon S3 service level agreement for availability. 

3. Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering: 
➢ The S3 intelligent tiering storage class is designed to optimize cost by 
automatically moving data to the most cost effective access tier. 
➢ It works by storing objects in two access tiers. 
➢ If an object in the frequent access tier is accessed it is automatically moved back 
to the frequent access tier. 
➢ There is no retrieval fees when using the S3 intelligent tiering storage class and 
no additional tering fees when objects are moved between access tiers. 
➢ Same low latency and high performance of S3 standard. 
➢ Objects less than 128kb cannot move to IA. 
➢ Durability is99.999999999%. 
➢ Availability is 99.9%. 

4. Amazon One-Zone IA 
➢ S3 one zone IA is for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid 
access when needed. 
➢ Data store is single AZ. 
➢ Ideal for those who want lower cost option of IA data. 
➢ It is good choice for storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data of 
easily re-creatable data. 
➢ You can use S3 lifecycle policies. 
➢ Durability is 99.999999999%. 
➢ Availability is 99.5%. 
➢ Because S3 one zone IA stores data in a single AZ, data stored in this storage 
class will be lost in the event of AZ destruction. 

5. Amazon S3 Glacier: 
➢ S3 glacier is a secure, durable, low cost storage class for data archiving. 
➢ To keep cost low yet suitable for varying needs S3 glacier provides three 
retrieval options that ranges from a few minutes to hours. 
➢ You can upload object directly to glacier or use lifecycle policies. 
➢ Durability is 99.999999999%. 
➢ Data is resilient in the event of one entire AZ destruction. 
➢ Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption data at rest. 
➢ You can retrieve 10GB of your amazon S3 glacier data per month for free with 
free tier account. 

6. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive: 
➢ S3 glacier deep archive is amazon S3 cheapest storage. 
➢ Design to retain data for long period even if for 10 years. 
➢ All objects stored in S3 glacier deep archive are replicated and stored across at 
least at three geographically AZ. 
➢ Durability is 99.999999999%. 
➢ Ideal alternative to magnetic tape libraries. 
➢ Retrieval time within 12 hours. 
➢ Storage cost is up to 75% less than for the existing S3 glacier storage class.
